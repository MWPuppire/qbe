# QBE

A wrapper library for QBE in Rust. An example is in `src/main.rs`.

I think the library is relatively complete, but many functions are undocumented.

It optionally includes the QBE source code and compiles it as a library to be able to create assembly output from the generated QBE IR, enabled with the `qbe-compile` feature (enabled by default).
